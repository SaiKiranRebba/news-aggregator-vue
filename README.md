##  Design Decisions

- **Vue 2** was chosen for this assignment .
- Components were broken down by concern (Card, Pagination, Pages).
- Global SCSS handles layout and theme, with dark mode via `body.dark-mode`.
- Routing is handled by `vue-router`; 

##  Trade-offs / Assumptions

- Assumes modern Chromium browsers for memory monitoring (performance.memory).
- If image not present showing the alt text.
- Used pagination logic.

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy loading images**: Reduces initial network cost using `loading="lazy"`.
- **Dark mode with CSS vars**: Avoids full DOM reflow, only color values change.
- **Debounced search input**: Limits API calls for every keystroke.
- **Scoped styles and grid layouts**: Ensures clean DOM updates.
